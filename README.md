A minimal psudo-Docker implementation heavily inspired by Liz's Rice [containers-from-scratch](https://github.com/lizrice/containers-from-scratch). This was meant to be a learning exercise after seeing her GOTO 2018 talk titled "Containers From Scratch" and being inspired to further that learning. Much of the base code is from her work and I especially recommend that you check out both the code and the talk!

1. Only works with Docker Hub for the container registry
2. There is no networking
